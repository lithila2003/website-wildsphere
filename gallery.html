                        <img src="./assests/2.jpg" alt="American Flamingo" data-title="American Flamingo" data-subheading="(Phoenicopterus ruber)" data-description="The American Flamingo is easily recognizable by its bright pink or reddish plumage, which is a result of their diet rich in carotenoid pigments found in algae and crustaceans. They have long, thin legs adapted for wading in shallow waters, and a unique, downward-bending beak used for filter-feeding. Their striking coloration and elegant stance make them a popular subject for photographers and bird watchers alike. Flamingos are social birds, often found in large flocks, and are known for their synchronized group displays, including coordinated head-flagging and wing-saluting behaviors.">

Reaching only up to 17.0 mm in length, this brightly colored amphibian is a skilled climber with sticky pads on its toes. Active during the day, it hunts for small insects.  Despite its size, its red and black patterned body is a warning - its skin contains toxins that can be dangerous to predators.">
                        <img src="./assests/5.jpg" alt="Impala" data-title="Impala" data-subheading="(Aepyceros melampus)" data-description="The male impala, an antelope native to the grasslands, savannas, and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, is known for its elegance and athleticism. Males boast impressive, lyre-shaped horns up to a meter long, complemented by black facial markings and a hint of a mane, setting them apart from the more simply adorned females. Female impalas lack these horns and facial markings, blending into their surroundings with their reddish-brown coats.">

Found mainly in Africa's grasslands and with a dwindling population in Iran, cheetahs are designed for speed with slender bodies, long legs, and a flexible spine that allows for incredible stride length. Their spotted coat provides excellent camouflage in the savanna, aiding in stealthy approaches to prey. Unlike other big cats, their semi-retractable claws offer constant traction, much like cleats, enhancing their grip during high-speed chases.">

These antlers, reaching up to 3 feet in length, display dominance during mating season. Herbivorous and social, red deer graze on grasses, leaves, shrubs, and fruits, living in herds led by a dominant male. Herd sizes vary by season and habitat, ranging from a few individuals to up to 100. Excellent runners, red deer can reach speeds of 48 kilometers per hour in short bursts.">
                        <img src="./assests/12.jpg" alt="Lion" data-title="Lion" data-subheading="(Panthera leo)" data-description="Lions are social cats found in Africa and some parts of India.  They are the second-largest big cat species after tigers.  Living in prides with females, cubs, and one or two males, these apex predators hunt large prey  like zebras, wildebeests, and  giraffes. Their powerful roar can be heard up to eight kilometers away, a mighty sound that echoes across the savanna.">

They stand up to 6 feet tall at the shoulder, weigh up to 3,900 pounds, and are recognized by a single horn on their snout. Covered in rough, grayish-brown skin with deep folds, they face threats from poaching and habitat loss, classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. Females and young form herds for safety, grazing on vegetation with acute senses to detect potential threats.">
                        <img src="./assests/14.jpg" alt="Common Kingfisher" data-title="Common Kingfisher" data-subheading="(Alcedo atthis)" data-description="The Common Kingfisher is a small bird with vivid blue and orange plumage, known for its long, sharp beak used to catch fish. It inhabits rivers, lakes, and ponds across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, favoring clear waters for hunting. During breeding season, it nests in burrows along riverbanks, showing territorial behavior over its fishing grounds. With precise diving abilities, it efficiently hunts fish despite its size, drawing attention with its bright colors and agile movements. Conservation efforts are critical to protect their populations from threats such as pollution and habitat destruction.">
